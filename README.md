I've been focused on immersive technologies (XR and WebXR) and decentralized web (web3, blockchain and digital assets).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Mintbase](https://github.com/Mintbase/) - an open multi-chain NFT protocol running on NEAR and Ethereum.
- Making [Mintbase.js](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js) a powerful open-source library for creating and trading digital assets.
